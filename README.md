# Doitsu
Simple and generic web framework, but also opinionated hehe.

## Requirements

- Make sure PHP is available on your system. We recommend PHP 8 or above.
- Make sure Composer is available on your system.

## How to run

- Clone this repository
- Go to the project directory (usually using `cd` command)
- Run `composer -vvv install` (this command is to install the dependencies)
- Run `php -S 0.0.0.0:4000 -t public` (this command is to run the built-in PHP web server for development purpose)
- Open the web on your browser at `http://localhost:4000` (until this point it means we already have `/` route that handle the home page)
