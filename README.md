# Doitsu
Simple web framework.

## Requirements

- Make sure PHP is available on your system. We recommend PHP 8 or above.
- Make sure Composer is available on your system.

## How to run

- Clone the repository
- Go to the project directory
- Run `composer -vvv install` (this to install the dependencies)
- Run `php -S 0.0.0.0:4000 -t public` (this is to run the built-in PHP web server for development purpose)
- Open the web on your browser at http://localhost:4000 (until this point means we already have / route that handle the home page)
